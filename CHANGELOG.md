and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Changed
- **Documentation Migration**: Merged `GEMINI.md` into `AGENTS.md` and removed devenv references from `README.md`. Added self-hosted services overview.
- **ghostship-config YAML Upserts**: Fixed Homepage-style list-group creation in `ghostship-config.py` so paths like `[Utilities].[OmniTools].icon` create missing groups with the correct list container and pass the script self-tests again.
- **RomM iframe startup hook**: Added a `podman-romm` `postStart` hook that patches RomM's routed iframe crash trigger in the active hashed frontend bundle and cleans up temporary debug assets created during live investigation.
- **VueTorrent WebUI pathing**: Stopped reapplying `/vuetorrent-ui/public` as qBittorrent's `WebUI\\RootFolder`. VueTorrent is now flattened into `/srv/apps/vuetorrent/ui`, mounted at `/vuetorrent-ui`, and served from the directory that actually contains `index.html`, fixing fresh-client `500` responses with `Unacceptable file type, only regular file is allowed.`.

### Added
- **ghostship-config Utility**: A self-verifying, idempotent configuration manager for surgical updates to XML, YAML, INI, and KV files. Supports secure secret injection via environment/file references.
- **Pure Surgical Migration**: Migrated all self-hosted services (Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, Homepage, etc.) to a pure surgical configuration model, removing all full-file templates and enforcing the "Ghostship Standard" for identity and privacy.
- **Unified Agent Tooling**: Added a shared `~/.agents`-based skill/instructions model and a Gemini delegation MCP server for repo research and plan generation across Gemini, OpenCode, and Codex.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-20

### Removed
- **Agent Browser Skill**: Removed the `agent-browser` Gemini skill definition. The `agent-browser-mcp` server remains active for tool-based browser automation.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **SSH Skill**: Created a new Gemini skill for advanced remote server management based on `mcp-ssh-manager`.
- **Agent Browser Skill**: Created a new Gemini skill for token-efficient browser automation via `agent-browser-mcp`.

### Changed
- **SSH MCP**: Swapped `@aiondadotcom/mcp-ssh` for `mcp-ssh-manager` by `bvisible` for enhanced remote management capabilities.
- **Browser Automation**: Swapped `browser-use` for `agent-browser-mcp` to leverage token-efficient accessibility trees and semantic locators.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **Gemini Template**: Overhauled `home/config/gemini.md` to follow 2026 Open Source Software (OSS) best practices.

- **Policies**: 
    - Established "Open Source Excellence" as a baseline for all projects.
    - Added "Continuous Learning" as a HIGH PRIORITY directive to record mistakes and new discoveries in project memory.
    - Prohibited `save_memory` in favor of centrally managed cross-project memory via user prompts.
    - Prioritized `nh` for all supported system operations.
    - Updated TDD policy to prioritize unit/integration tests for applications and test environments for infra/config.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Python Skill**: Added a new Gemini skill for modern Python development using `uv`, Nix flakes, `black`, `isort`, and `pyright`/`pylance`.

### Added
- **SSH MCP**: Added `mcp-ssh` for remote task execution via `@aiondadotcom/mcp-ssh`.
- **Browser Automation**: Switched from `playwright` to `browser-use` MCP using `mcp-browser-use`.
- **Gemini Extension**: Installed `richardcb/oh-my-gemini` for advanced workflow orchestration.
- **System Packages**: Added `uv` to common system packages for MCP runners.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- **Gemini Config**: Enabled the experimental `plan` mode in `modules/develop/gemini.nix`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Host Bootstrap Script**: Implemented `bootstrap.sh` for initial host setup, age key generation, and hardware configuration capture.
- **Host Registration**: Added `register-host` CLI tool to automatically integrate new hosts (updating `.sops.yaml`, creating host directories, and re-encrypting secrets).
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive "Bootstrap a New Host" section to `README.md`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09
