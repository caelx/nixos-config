## Unreleased

### Changed
- **Hermes workspace mount**: Added a dedicated persistent Hermes workspace at
  `/srv/apps/hermes/workspace`, bind-mounted directly into the container at
  `/home/hermes/workspace` while leaving the native `/home/hermes/.hermes`
  state mount unchanged.
- **Muximux service placement**: Removed Honcho from the generated Muximux tile
  list, moved PriceBuddy back into the Muximux dropdown directly after Bazarr,
  and keep the generated dashboard layout aligned with the retired Honcho
  stack.
- **Honcho retirement**: Removed the Honcho self-hosted stack, dropped Hermes'
  `HONCHO_*` integration wiring and shared Honcho compatibility-state
  management, removed Homepage Honcho entries, and removed the stale
  `litellm-secrets` declaration now that the service is retired.
- **Homepage stale-entry pruning**: Homepage activation now explicitly deletes
  stale `Honcho`, `Honcho Redis`, and `Honcho DB` entries from `services.yaml`
  after `ghostship-config set` so retired services do not linger in the live UI.
- **PriceBuddy token verification**: Normalized the managed
  `pricebuddy-agent.env` bearer rewrite so repeated post-start runs preserve a
  single `id|token` pair, and added host-managed post-start checks for the app
  env files, scraper reachability, and final token format without conflating
  known upstream auth-route or Cloudflare target issues with Ghostship runtime
  wiring.
- **OpenCode programming free-model refresh**: The develop-host `opencode`
  wrapper now refreshes a generated OpenCode config once per UTC day from
  OpenRouter's ranked programming free-model frontend endpoint, stores that
  generated config under the user's state directory, exports `OPENCODE_CONFIG`
  to it at launch, sources the free programming models from that endpoint, and
  rewrites the generated OpenCode model display labels from `(free)` to
  `(ghostship-free)`. The static OpenRouter model maps were removed from both
  Nix-managed OpenCode config paths, which now only retain the explicit
  `permission = "allow"` default.
- **Develop auth cache policy**: Moved the managed `ssh-agent` setup into the
  develop Home Manager profile, switched it to a fixed `/run/user/1000/ssh-agent`
  socket with a `12h` key lifetime, removed the brittle WSL-only post-start
  parser that could leave the user service failed, and made develop-host
  `sudo` credential caching global with a `12h` timeout so fresh agent PTYs do
  not constantly re-prompt while server-only hosts keep the stricter default
  scope.
- **Hermes native image layout**: Removed the repo-side Hermes startup shim,
  entrypoint override, command override, writable `/nix` volume, and separate
  `.honcho` bind mount so `chill-penguin` now follows the image's native
  `/usr/local/bin/ghostship-hermes-runtime entrypoint` contract. The host-side
  Honcho config is migrated into `/srv/apps/hermes/home/shared/honcho` so the
  image can recreate `/home/hermes/.honcho` through its native compatibility
  layout.
- **Develop agent launcher defaults**: Develop-host `codex`, `gemini`, and
  `opencode` now declare explicit YOLO or allow-all execution defaults in
  their generated configs instead of relying on mixed upstream behavior.
- **Muximux RomM embedding**: Switched Muximux's RomM tile to a same-origin
  `/romm/` reverse proxy and now install a managed Muximux nginx vhost that
  proxies RomM by service name on `ghostship_net`, because the public
  `romm.ghostship.io` hostname is Cloudflare Access-protected and not a stable
  iframe target.
- **RomM startup hook removal**: Removed the stale `podman-romm` post-start
  bundle rewrite after validating that the upstream RomM `4.8.0` image starts
  cleanly without it; the failing patch target was the source of the live
  startup wedge.
- **RomM iframe shim**: Muximux now injects an iframe-only RomM runtime shim
  ahead of RomM's main module entry instead of rewriting the served RomM bundle
  on disk, and the shim cache-bust is owned by the Muximux config so Chrome can
  be forced onto corrected injection changes without touching RomM assets.
- **OpenSpec init defaults**: The develop-host `openspec` wrapper now injects
  `--tools codex,gemini,opencode --profile core` for `openspec init` unless
  the caller passes explicit `--tools` or `--profile` flags.
- **Shell flake timeouts**: Increased Starship's prompt scan timeout and
  direnv's warning timeout to 30 seconds so slow `use flake` environments have
  more time to initialize before the prompt or warning path gives up.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-02

### Removed
- **LiteLLM stack**: Removed LiteLLM and its dedicated Postgres container from the self-hosted stack for now, along with Homepage and Muximux entries and the active `litellm-secrets` declaration. Encrypted secret material in `secrets.yaml` is left untouched until it is intentionally cleaned up.

### Changed
- **Agent memory rewrite**: Rewrote the repo `AGENTS.md` into a shorter
  operating-memory format so it keeps durable repo facts without turning into a
  running debug log, and aligned the shared `home/config/AGENTS.md` preference
  layer with the newer commit/verification/documentation workflow.
- **Shared skill rename**: Renamed the vendored shared `skill-creator` skill to
  `skills-creator` locally while keeping it pinned to the upstream
  `vercel-labs/agent-browser` `skill-creator` package.
- **Python skill defaults**: Updated the shared Python skill to require `src/`
  layout, `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, and `basedpyright`, with `ruff format .`,
  `ruff check .`, full-project `pytest`, and full type coverage as the default
  workflow.
- **SSH interaction guidance**: Tightened the shared SSH skill around
  non-blocking tmux-driven remote workflows so prompt-driven commands are
  started in detached tmux sessions and advanced through `capture-pane` plus
  `send-keys`.
- **WSL path guidance**: Updated the shared WSL skill to prefer `/mnt/c/...`
  for Windows files, added `wslpath` conversion guidance, and refreshed the
  PowerShell reference with tested non-interactive patterns for this host,
  including the requirement to use a Windows path with
  `powershell.exe -File`.
- **OpenSpec agent workflow**: Replaced the old Superpowers-based CLI workflow with repo-local OpenSpec scaffolding for Codex/Gemini/OpenCode, exposed an `openspec` CLI wrapper in the shared develop toolchain, and migrated active planning references from `docs/superpowers` to the repo-root `openspec/` tree.
- **Legacy Superpowers cleanup**: Develop-profile activation now removes the old `~/.agents/skills/superpowers`, `~/.gemini/extensions/superpowers`, and `~/.config/opencode/plugins/superpowers` checkouts and prunes Gemini's stale enablement record during activation.
- **Agent launcher preflight**: Standardized the develop-host `codex`, `gemini`, and `opencode` wrappers around a shared `npx` launch flow that refreshes global `skills`, refreshes OpenSpec instructions when launched inside an OpenSpec repo, warns instead of aborting on preflight failures, and keeps Gemini extension updates behind the same warning-only contract.
- **Shared skill curation**: Reduced the repo-managed shared skill inventory to `nix`, `python`, `ssh`, `wsl2`, and the vendored shared `skills-creator` package, removed the local `agent-browser`, `build123d`, and `dispatching-cli-subagents` skills, and rewrote the retained local skills into a leaner modular format aligned with current skills.sh guidance.
- **Flake repo shell**: Added a default Linux `devShell` to the root flake so `.envrc` `use flake`, `direnv`, and `nix develop` all work in the local development environments without changing any host outputs.
- **agent-browser local runtime**: Wrapped the develop-host `agent-browser` command with a Nix-managed browser `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so Puppeteer's downloaded Chrome can launch on NixOS/WSL instead of failing on missing GTK/NSS/X11/GBM shared libraries.
- **SearXNG direct-network max-open tuning**: Moved SearXNG off the Gluetun network namespace onto `ghostship_net`, switched Hermes to the internal `http://searxng:8080` address, restored the container's default internal port `8080`, replaced the implicit default-engine inheritance with a Nix-managed allowlist plus category/weight overrides, moved SearXNG config generation into `podman-searxng` `preStart` so engine changes restart cleanly, and pruned repeatedly blocked or unstable engines such as Brave, Qwant, Kickass, SolidTorrents, PodcastIndex, Geizhals, Tootfinder, and Semantic Scholar from the live search surface.
- **SearXNG live tuning follow-up**: Re-ran the public Access-protected SearXNG instance through iterative API and browser probes, removed engines that still failed or degraded quality off VPN (`annas archive`, `mojeek news`, `qwant*`, plain `duckduckgo`, and the full Brave family), kept stronger contributors like `mojeek`, `google`, `duckduckgo news/images/videos`, `reuters`, `youtube`, `sepiasearch`, and `bt4g`, and added a Google fallback into the `it` category so agent-style infrastructure queries no longer return empty result sets.
- **SearXNG Brave reinstatement**: Re-enabled `brave`, `brave.news`, `brave.images`, and `brave.videos` in the curated engine allowlist because the active search policy now explicitly favors Brave's independent index coverage over the operational cleanliness gained by pruning its rate-limited engine family.
- **SearXNG autocomplete**: Switched the instance autocomplete backend from `duckduckgo` to `bing` after live benchmarking showed Bing suggestions were faster and more complete for agent-style queries than DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Wikipedia, Mwmbl, or Brave.
- **SearXNG category tuning**: Rebalanced the curated engine set around the current agentic-search priorities by enabling Bing web search, Repology package search, Apple Maps, Google Play Apps, Erowid, Moviepilot, and additional icon engines, removing `hoogle` and `gentoo`, promoting Reuters/Google News/YouTube/Wikipedia in their respective categories, and narrowing package, software-wiki, app, movie, and icon engines to the categories where they provide the strongest signal.
- **SearXNG category tuning follow-up**: Dropped `svgrepo` again after live icon probes immediately hit rate limits, and raised per-engine timeouts on the slower app, package, icon, and Erowid sources so the engines explicitly kept for those categories have a chance to contribute before the global request cutoff.
- **SearXNG package and other cleanup**: Removed `duckduckgo weather` after repeated live `400` errors on non-weather queries, pushed package search harder toward `pypi`, `repology`, and Alpine, and demoted the long tail of ecosystem-specific package registries into `it` so package-name lookups are less dominated by unrelated exact-name matches.
- **SearXNG PyPI engine override**: Replaced the upstream PyPI HTML scraper with a local exact-match engine mounted into the container that uses PyPI's JSON API, and marked curated engines `inactive = false` so default-off engines like `repology` can be activated reliably from the repo-managed engine list.
- **SearXNG weather source swap**: Replaced `openmeteo` with `wttr.in` in the curated weather category after live tests showed the old weather path returning no useful answers while wttr's upstream JSON endpoint remained healthy.
- **Global Bash defaults**: Moved Bash completion and baseline readline/history behavior into the shared NixOS layer so all Bash shells, including root, now get `bash-completion`, case-insensitive ambiguous completion, cleaner history handling, incremental history writes, and `checkwinsize` by default.
- **CloakBrowser healthcheck**: Replaced the `wget --spider` Podman probe with a Python `urllib` GET against the local manager endpoint, because the current image on `chill-penguin` serves the app correctly but still reports repeated false-negative healthcheck failures under the `wget` runner.
- **Host role refactor**: Added explicit `ghostship.host.roles` booleans, split WSL into its own top-level module area, and moved Home Manager into `base`, `server`, `develop`, and `wsl` profile layers. Server-role hosts now default to `bash`, develop-role hosts default to `fish`, and the package split is cleaner between system packages and user packages.
- **Flake host construction**: Consolidated repeated `nixosSystem` wiring behind a shared `mkHost` helper and removed the unused `nixpkgs-unstable` input.
- **Self-hosted inventory consistency**: Reordered the flat self-hosted module inventory into documented category blocks and removed the last non-Plex host port exposure by keeping CloakBrowser on internal networking with the standard Podman healthcheck cadence.
- **Workflow docs**: Rewrote the local workflow guidance to match the actual repo workflow instead of the old `plan.md`-driven process.
- **Docker Hub auth support**: Added a `dockerhub-secrets` bundle and runtime auth-file generation so the self-hosted Podman stack can authenticate Docker Hub pulls instead of hitting rate limits during restart-time updates.
- **Docker Hub placeholder fallback**: The Docker Hub auth hook now writes an empty `auths` file when the secret bundle still contains the placeholder values, so public pulls can continue anonymously instead of failing the whole stack during deploy.
- **Podman auto-update**: Every self-hosted OCI container now sets `pull = "always";` and carries Podman's registry auto-update label, and a daily native `podman auto-update` timer refreshes changed images in place. Failed restarts are still surfaced through systemd/journal for now.
- **WSL `/mnt/z` NFS mount**: Replaced the WSL-only `Z:`-backed SMB mount script with a direct Synology NFS automount at `/mnt/z`, reusing the tuned `chill-penguin` mount options so access is faster on-network and fails gracefully when the NAS is unavailable or the host is off-network.
- **PyLoad healthcheck**: Switched the PyLoad container health probe from `/` to `/api`, because the current web UI config can leave the root path in an internal redirect loop even while the service itself is healthy.
- **LiteLLM database startup**: LiteLLM now writes a runtime env file that maps the existing secret bundle onto the `DATABASE_URL` variable the upstream image actually uses, and the Postgres side now writes a real `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` runtime env file instead of passing the literal `env:LITELLM_DB_PASS` marker through to the container. The LiteLLM Postgres unit also reconciles the `litellm` role password from secrets on startup so older initialized volumes converge to the current secret. This allows Prisma migrations to run and fixes the LiteLLM UI's `Not connected to DB!` login failure on `chill-penguin`.
- **LiteLLM ChatGPT subscription wiring**: LiteLLM now mounts a persistent ChatGPT OAuth token directory and ships a proxy config for the current `chatgpt/` provider models (`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-pro`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `gpt-5.3-instant`, and `gpt-5.3-chat-latest`) so ChatGPT-subscription-backed models can be added without API keys and keep their OAuth session across container restarts.
- **Native Nix docs**: Updated the repo documentation and agent instructions to use native `nix`, `nixos-rebuild`, and `switch-to-configuration` commands instead of `nh`.
- **CloakBrowser native origin patch**: Replaced the custom aiohttp proxy with a startup patch against the upstream manager's `AuthMiddleware`, so the app now strips incoming `Origin` headers at the ASGI boundary and keeps the native VNC/CDP WebSocket handling intact.
- **PyLoad config application**: `ghostship-config` now recognizes `pyload.cfg` as PyLoad's typed config format and updates the existing section/key lines in place, so the PyLoad activation settings actually take effect instead of being appended as invalid `section.key=value` lines.
- **PyLoad NFS startup**: Restored the LinuxServer image's supported root-run startup mode and replaced the broken `fix-attrs/down` override with a narrow patch to `init-pyload-config/run` that keeps `/config` ownership handling but skips the `/downloads` `chown` on the NFS share.
- **Documentation Migration**: Merged `GEMINI.md` into `AGENTS.md` and removed devenv references from `README.md`. Added self-hosted services overview.
- **ghostship-config YAML Upserts**: Fixed Homepage-style list-group creation in `ghostship-config.py` so paths like `[Utilities].[OmniTools].icon` create missing groups with the correct list container and pass the script self-tests again.
- **Homepage resources widget typing**: The Homepage activation script now writes the resources widget's `cpu`, `memory`, and `network` options as native YAML booleans instead of quoted strings, which restores the network bandwidth section instead of showing `API Error`.
- **Homepage network stats mount**: Homepage now keeps the resources widget pinned to `end0` on `chill-penguin` and mounts only the network-related sysfs paths needed to resolve `end0`'s host symlink target, avoiding the broken `/sys/class/net` links without exposing the wider `/sys` tree that made Homepage's disk probe fail.
- **RomM iframe startup hook**: Added a `podman-romm` `postStart` hook that patches RomM's routed iframe crash trigger in the active hashed frontend bundle and cleans up temporary debug assets created during live investigation.
- **VueTorrent LSIO integration**: Replaced the hand-managed VueTorrent zip extraction with the official `ghcr.io/vuetorrent/vuetorrent-lsio-mod` on the LinuxServer qBittorrent image. The service no longer forces `-u 3000:3000`, the stale manual `/srv/apps/vuetorrent/ui` state is removed during activation, and qBittorrent is configured to use `/vuetorrent`, avoiding the recurring `Unacceptable file type, only regular file is allowed.` failure.
- **Gluetun PIA compatibility**: The `podman-gluetun` `preStart` hook now mirrors legacy `OPENVPN_PASS` into `OPENVPN_PASSWORD` before writing `/run/secrets/gluetun-runtime.env`, keeping the current Gluetun image compatible with the existing secret bundle on `chill-penguin`.

### Added
- **SSH workflow references**: Added shared SSH skill references for common
  tmux background patterns and interactive SSH command patterns.
- **Honcho stack**: Added a local Honcho stack for Hermes using one s6-supervised app container plus database and Redis sidecars, wired Hermes to generate `~/.honcho/config.json` at startup, and added Homepage and Muximux entries.
- **RSS-Bridge and PriceBuddy**: Added internal-only RSS-Bridge and PriceBuddy services to the Ghostship stack, wired both into Homepage's Services column, added the PriceBuddy MySQL/scraper sidecars, and sourced the persistent PriceBuddy agent API token from the `pricebuddy-secrets` bundle.
- **PriceBuddy env bootstrap**: Moved PriceBuddy env-file generation into the service start path so the MySQL and app containers can see `/srv/apps/pricebuddy/{pricebuddy.env,pricebuddy-db.env,pricebuddy-agent.env}` reliably after secrets are installed.
- **PriceBuddy bearer format**: The persisted agent token now writes a shell-safe `PRICEBUDDY_API_TOKEN="id|token"` bearer line into `/srv/apps/pricebuddy/pricebuddy-agent.env` so non-interactive API calls authenticate correctly.
- **PriceBuddy process env**: Restored PriceBuddy's app `environmentFiles` so the upstream `start-app.sh` sees the DB host and credentials it waits on before Apache starts.
- **Nix command reference**: Added a native Nix command reference under the Nix skill with build-first, no-`sudo`, and `chill-penguin-root` deployment guidance.
- **Hermes service**: Added a new `ghcr.io/caelx/ghostship-hermes:latest` self-hosted service with Homepage and Muximux entries, internal service URL wiring for the existing stack, RomM/Grimmory secret imports for `*_USER` / `*_PASS`, and a named Podman volume for `/nix` so the image keeps its bundled entrypoint store.
- **ghostship-config Utility**: A self-verifying, idempotent configuration manager for surgical updates to XML, YAML, INI, and KV files. Supports secure secret injection via environment/file references.
- **Pure Surgical Migration**: Migrated all self-hosted services (Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, Homepage, etc.) to a pure surgical configuration model, removing all full-file templates and enforcing the "Ghostship Standard" for identity and privacy.
- **Unified Agent Tooling**: Added a shared `~/.agents`-based skill/instructions model and a Gemini delegation MCP server for repo research and plan generation across Gemini, OpenCode, and Codex.
