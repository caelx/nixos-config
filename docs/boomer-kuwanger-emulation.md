# Boomer Kuwanger Emulation PC

`boomer-kuwanger` is managed as a dedicated NixOS emulation box through the
split `modules/emulation/` module set. The host boots directly into ES-DE under
Gamescope through the `kiosk` user. `start-esde` remains available as a manual
launch helper for maintenance sessions. It keeps writable emulator state under
`/srv/emulation` and launches every configured system through the repo-managed
`run-emulator` wrapper.

## Runtime Layout

- `/srv/emulation/roms`: local ROM root, mounted from the 4 TB Btrfs filesystem
  labeled `roms`.
- `/srv/emulation/bios`: BIOS, firmware, keys, and other user-provided files.
- `/srv/emulation/saves`, `/srv/emulation/states`, `/srv/emulation/screenshots`:
  runtime output outside ROM folders.
- `/srv/emulation/config`: emulator overrides, display policy, RetroArch
  profiles, per-core options, controller state, and TeknoParrot prefix state.
- `/srv/emulation/es-de`: ES-DE appdata, settings, themes, custom systems, and
  scraped media.
- `/srv/emulation/logs`: launch, RetroArch, controller, and tool logs.
- `/home/kiosk/Emulation`: symlink to `/srv/emulation`.

The Boomer host config uses label-based mounts. The emulation module's optional
`ghostship.emulation.romDisk.uuid` remains available for non-Boomer deployments,
but Boomer itself expects the installed disks to use the labels below.

## Disk Layout

`/dev/nvme0n1` is the 512 GB OS disk:

- `p1`: 1 GiB FAT32, label `BOOT`, mounted at `/boot`.
- `p2`: 32 GiB swap, label `swap`.
- `p3`: remaining space Btrfs, label `nixos`, mounted at `/`.

`/dev/nvme1n1` is the 4 TB ROM disk:

- `p1`: whole disk Btrfs, label `roms`, mounted at `/srv/emulation/roms`.

Btrfs mounts use `noatime`, `compress=zstd:1`, and `discard=async`. The ROM
mount intentionally avoids `autodefrag`.

## Frontend

ES-DE is mandatory; Pegasus is not used. The module installs ES-DE 3.4.1 from
the official AppImage package, sets `ESDE_APPDATA_DIR=/srv/emulation/es-de`,
installs Art Book Next, and generates:

- `/srv/emulation/es-de/custom_systems/es_systems.xml`
- `/srv/emulation/es-de/custom_systems/es_find_rules.xml`
- `/srv/emulation/es-de/settings/es_settings.xml`

`sync-esde-config` creates or refreshes the appdata skeleton at boot.
Additional setup scripts sync RetroArch, ES-DE tools, and standalone emulator
config scaffolds before the frontend starts. Existing ES-DE settings are
preserved after first creation so runtime UI changes can survive rebuilds,
except for managed defaults such as theme, systems sorting, display clock, and
controller UI hints. ES-DE menu input is available from all connected
controllers, not only player 1. Boomer runs in Hawaii standard time and the
managed Art Book Next theme package uses ES-DE's supported `%H:%M` clock
format so the hour renders reliably. True 12-hour time needs ES-DE formatter
support beyond the official AppImage's theme tokens.

During bootstrap, use:

- `esde-preflight` to check DRM, Vulkan, ES-DE appdata, and service
  readiness.
- `start-esde` to launch ES-DE manually under Gamescope on the RX 6650M and
  the currently connected HDMI/DP output.
- `esde-status` to inspect the active session and latest logs.
- `stop-esde` to return control to `getty@tty1`.

ES-DE game launches reuse the frontend Gamescope session. Direct tty launches
still wrap emulators in DRM Gamescope, but nested Gamescope is skipped when
`DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is already present.

The ES-DE AppImage runs under bubblewrap, so the systemd session clears Linux
capabilities before launching Gamescope. Keep that service hardening in place
unless ES-DE is rebuilt from source.

## ROMs

The module maps every ROM folder discovered under `/mnt/z/Library/ROMs/roms`
into ES-DE. On boot, if a matching `/mnt/z` source folder is visible and
`/srv/emulation/roms/<folder>` is missing, the setup service creates a symlink.
Otherwise it creates an empty local folder, which should be hidden by the real
`roms` mount on the installed machine.

RetroArch is preferred when a usable, RetroAchievements-compatible libretro
core exists. Standalone emulators are installed where they are the better
operational or RetroAchievements target: Dolphin, Cemu, xemu,
Ryubing/Ryujinx, Azahar, PCSX2, PPSSPP, Supermodel, GZDoom, PICO-8, and
TeknoParrot free.

Ryubing uses the official Canary Linux x64 release, not nixpkgs' stable
`ryubing` package. The current pin follows the official latest redirect at
`https://update.ryujinx.app/latest/canary` and is recorded in
`modules/emulation/ryubing-canary-pin.nix`. Run this before a Boomer rebuild to
advance the pin when upstream publishes a new Canary:

```sh
scripts/update-ryubing-canary /root/nixos-config
```

Nix still needs a fixed hash, so the build itself stays reproducible; the
updater is the intentional step that converts "latest Canary" into a Nix pin.
Switch homebrew `.nro` entries can keep their asset folders beside the launched
file. When `run-emulator` sees a sibling `data/` directory, it links that
directory into Ryubing's emulated SD card at
`/srv/emulation/xdg/config/Ryujinx/sdcard/data`, replacing only an existing
symlink. Proprietary keys stay operator-managed under
`/srv/emulation/bios/switch` and are exposed to Ryubing's runtime system
directory at launch.

## GZDoom

The Doom system uses the source library folder `Fantasy - GZDoom (2005)` in
ES-DE and accepts normal WAD/PK3 files plus Batocera-style `.gzdoom` launchers.
A `.gzdoom` launcher is a text file with one non-empty GZDoom argument line,
for example:

```text
-iwad assets/Doom II - Hell on Earth/DOOM2.WAD -file assets/SIGIL/SIGIL_v1_21.wad
```

`run-emulator` parses that line with shell-style quoting, does not execute it
through a shell, and launches GZDoom from the `.gzdoom` file's directory so
relative asset paths work. Keep assets under the Doom ROM folder and put the
human-facing launchers at the top level for cleaner ES-DE scraping.
Every GZDoom launch executes the managed
`/srv/emulation/config/emulators/gzdoom/boomer-controls.cfg` file so joystick
input is enabled and the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Switch Pro-mode controls are
applied: left stick moves, right stick looks left/right and up/down with
vertical look scaled to 25%, R2/ZR is Fire, L2/ZL is Alt Fire, A is
Use/Confirm, B is Jump/Back, X toggles crouch, Y reloads, D-pad left/right
selects previous/next weapon, D-pad up selects the previous inventory item,
D-pad down uses the selected inventory item, Select/Minus toggles the map, and
Start/Plus opens the menu. L1/R1 are mapped to User 1/User 2 for mod actions.
L4/R4 are intentionally unbound until a live probe shows unique events for
those buttons; do not invent `JoyN` bindings for them. Square/Capture is also
unbound for GZDoom. The managed GZDoom package also patches joystick menu
handling so physical Switch A advances menus and physical Switch B backs out.
The setup script also writes GZDoom's `[Joy:JS:*]` SDL axis map so left X/Y are
strafe/forward, right X/Y are yaw/pitch, `Axis3scale` is `0.25`, trigger axes
are used only as fire/alt-fire button fallbacks, and unused/phantom axes cannot
drive the view upward on launch.
The reset GZDoom raw binding baseline is the older working layout:
`Joy1`/`Joy2` are physical B/A, `Joy3`/`Joy4` are physical Y/X,
`Joy5`/`Joy6` are L1/R1, `Joy7`/`Joy8` are R2/L2, `Joy9` is Start/Plus,
`Joy10` is Select/Minus, and `POV1*` is the D-pad.

### Switch Pro Raw Input Probe

The current Boomer controller baseline was probed on April 30, 2026 from
`/dev/input/event16` (`Pro Controller`) with the raw log saved on Boomer at
`/srv/emulation/logs/controller-probes/raw-20260430-135115.log`.
SDL's live controller mapping was also probed at
`/srv/emulation/logs/controller-probes/sdl-20260430-140039.log`; it reported
`a:b0,b:b1,x:b2,y:b3,back:b4,start:b6,leftshoulder:b9,rightshoulder:b10,lefttrigger:a4,righttrigger:a5,dp*:h0`.
This table is the kernel event layer, not the authoritative GZDoom `JoyN`
binding map. The available probe did not show unique L4/R4 events.

| Physical control | Linux event |
| --- | --- |
| B / South | `EV_KEY 304 BTN_SOUTH` |
| A / East | `EV_KEY 305 BTN_EAST` |
| X / North | `EV_KEY 307 BTN_NORTH` |
| Y / West | `EV_KEY 308 BTN_WEST` |
| Square / Capture | `EV_KEY 309 BTN_Z` |
| L1 / L | `EV_KEY 310 BTN_TL` |
| R1 / R | `EV_KEY 311 BTN_TR` |
| L2 / ZL | `EV_KEY 312 BTN_TL2` |
| R2 / ZR | `EV_KEY 313 BTN_TR2` |
| Select / `-` | `EV_KEY 314 BTN_SELECT` |
| Start / `+` | `EV_KEY 315 BTN_START` |
| Left stick click | `EV_KEY 317 BTN_THUMBL` |
| Right stick click | `EV_KEY 318 BTN_THUMBR` |
| D-pad left/right | `EV_ABS 16 ABS_HAT0X`, `-1` left and `1` right |
| D-pad up/down | `EV_ABS 17 ABS_HAT0Y`, `-1` up and `1` down |
| Left stick X/Y | `EV_ABS 0 ABS_X`, `EV_ABS 1 ABS_Y` |
| Right stick X/Y | `EV_ABS 3 ABS_RX`, `EV_ABS 4 ABS_RY` |
| Star / Home | Not observed in this probe; may be controller-local |

## BIOS, Firmware, And Keys

Keep all proprietary runtime files out of the repo:

- Imported BIOS source mirror: `/srv/emulation/bios/systems`
- Switch firmware and keys: `/srv/emulation/bios/switch`
- PlayStation/PlayStation 2 BIOS: `/srv/emulation/bios`
- Sega CD, Saturn, Neo Geo CD, PC Engine CD BIOS: `/srv/emulation/bios`
- Xbox MCPX, BIOS, and HDD image material for xemu: `/srv/emulation/bios/xbox`

The Nix module creates Xemu's machine settings at
`/srv/emulation/xdg/share/xemu/xemu/xemu.toml`, disables Xemu's welcome wizard
and menubar, and launches Xemu with that config explicitly. Keep
`mcpx_1.0.bin`, `Complex_4627.bin`, and `xbox_hdd.qcow2` under
`/srv/emulation/bios/xbox`. Name launchable Xbox images with the `.xiso`
suffix and keep redump backups from ending in `.iso` so ES-DE does not list
the unbootable video partition dumps.
Current smoke coverage has confirmed these BIOS-gated files are still needed
for the selected disc tests: `scph5500.bin` for Japanese PlayStation,
`mpr-17933.bin` for Saturn, and a valid Neo Geo CD BIOS set for NeoCD.

## PICO-8

The official PICO-8 zip is consumed with `pkgs.requireFile`:

- Expected source: `/mnt/c/Users/james/Downloads/pico-8_0.2.7_amd64.zip`
- Hash: `sha256-1alyii0bc9r9j2519q3jhxn8xazrcffy0kl8k07mnn208y2wxwpd`

The package wraps the Linux PICO-8 binary with `steam-run` so it can launch on
NixOS without committing proprietary files.

PICO-8 uses SDL's X11 video path on Boomer, so `run-emulator` adds an explicit
Gamescope Xwayland server for PICO-8 launches. Current smoke coverage uses
`POOM.png` from the PICO-8 library as the heavier test cart.

## TeknoParrot Free

Only the free TeknoParrot path is scaffolded. No premium unlocks, bypasses,
commercial game files, or third-party patch packs are managed.

Place official free TeknoParrot files under:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/teknoparrot/TeknoParrot
```

The wrapper uses a dedicated Wine prefix at:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/teknoparrot/prefix
```

ES-DE lists `.teknoparrot` launcher files. Each launcher is a small text file
whose first non-comment line is parsed as a raw argument string, matching the
`.gzdoom` launcher style. If the first argument names a payload beside the
launcher, `run-emulator` runs it from that payload directory; otherwise the
arguments are passed to TeknoParrotUi. Keep copied game payloads under hidden
`.assets/` directories beside those launchers.

## Display And Aspect Scaling

`display-profile` discovers connected DRM outputs first, prefers the RX 6650M,
supports either HDMI port, and falls back to Wayland/X11 resolution probes when
needed. It emits JSON with the selected connector, DRM card, output size,
render size, aspect class, viewport recommendations, and Gamescope arguments.
`run-emulator` wraps emulator launches in Gamescope by default.

The default policy:

- Run ES-DE at native display resolution.
- Never use Gamescope FSR.
- Keep `render_width`/`render_height` equal to the active display output.
- Use emulator-native internal resolution scaling for standalone and 3D
  systems.
- Use RetroArch Slang shaders for clean 2D scaling.
- Center fixed-aspect systems on ultrawide displays unless a native widescreen
  emulator mode is selected later.

Runtime override knobs can live in `/srv/emulation/config/display.env` for
manual testing, but durable policy changes belong in the Nix module.
Run `display-profile --matrix-test` to verify native render/output sizing,
`fsr=false`, and aspect-safe viewport recommendations without display hardware.

## Audio

Audio uses PipeWire with Pulse compatibility. `audio-route` runs from the
frontend session, emulator launcher, and user service to prefer the AMD
Navi 21/23 HDMI/DP audio card over USB audio adapters. It does not hardcode one
physical HDMI port; it asks PipeWire which AMD HDMI/DP profile is currently
`available`, sets that card profile, and makes the matching HDMI sink default.
If `Bluetooth Settings` selects a connected Bluetooth audio sink, `audio-route`
honors that preference and falls back to HDMI when the Bluetooth sink is absent.

Run `audio-route` from SSH to inspect and repair the route.

## Smoke ROMs

Smoke ROM tooling lives under `/srv/emulation/smoke-roms` and
`/srv/emulation/config/smoke/roms.json`.

- `smoke-rom-select`: selects up to three top-level ROM entries per non-empty
  source system, preferring demanding known titles and otherwise choosing the
  largest entries.
- `smoke-rom-sync`: copies the selected entries into the smoke ROM tree.
- `smoke-test`: launches each selected entry through `run-emulator`, with
  Gamescope, GameMode, and MangoHud logging.
- `smoke-report`: summarizes the latest test run.

The smoke harness is intended for target-display validation. A `--dry-run`
mode prints the exact `run-emulator` calls without launching games. Root-run
smoke tests re-exec as `kiosk` on tty1 with cleared capability sets so
`steam-run`/bubblewrap-based emulators, including PICO-8, launch the same way
they do from ES-DE. On kiosk-mode hosts, the wrapper stops `greetd` only while
the test owns tty1 and restores `greetd` afterward so the console returns to
ES-DE instead of a login prompt.

The runtime launcher does not transform ROMs. If a smoke entry fails because
the selected copied entry is an archive or folder shape that the emulator will
not open, manually extract only that smoke copy and point `roms.json` at the
playable file. The final ROM set should already be stored in the launchable
shape expected by the target emulator.

## Performance Testing

Performance tooling builds on the smoke ROM manifest and always launches
through `run-emulator`, so Gamescope, GameMode, HDMI audio routing, display
policy, RetroArch profile selection, and emulator logging follow the same path
as normal play. Gamescope FSR remains disabled for every run.

Runtime state:

- `/srv/emulation/config/perf/policy.json`: mode defaults, thresholds, shader
  profiles, scaling profiles, and tuning notes.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/context.json`: package versions, kernel,
  display profile, audio summary, Vulkan summary, and mapped systems.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/results.jsonl`: one JSON result per ROM
  and profile.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/recommended-changes.json`: proposed
  tuning changes only; nothing is applied automatically.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/mangohud/*.csv`: raw MangoHud frame data.

Commands:

- `perf-test --quick`: one ROM per mapped system, 75 seconds each with a
  15-second warmup.
- `perf-test --overnight`: up to three ROMs per mapped system, 180 seconds each
  with a 30-second warmup.
- `perf-test --shader-matrix`: RetroArch systems only, comparing default,
  `nnedi3-fast`, `nnedi3-clean`, `sharp-bilinear-prescale`, and `no-shader`.
- `perf-test --scaling-matrix`: standalone systems only, recording baseline,
  quality, and performance scaling profiles for emulator-native tuning.
- `perf-test --single <system> <rom>`: focused debug run for one ROM.
- `perf-report`: latest report table with average FPS, 1% low, p99 frame time,
  status, and recommendations.
- `perf-compare`: compares two runs and flags >3% FPS regressions or >2 ms p99
  frame-time regressions.
- Root-run performance tests use the same capability-cleared tty re-exec path
  as the smoke harness so fullscreen Gamescope launches match the production
  kiosk session.
- `perf-profile current`: shows the active RetroArch profile and current
  standalone runtime scaling policy files.

Use `--duration`, `--warmup`, and `--systems` for short validation loops, for
example:

```sh
perf-test --shader-matrix --systems nes,pcengine,gba,snes,fbneo --duration 12 --warmup 2
perf-test --scaling-matrix --systems psp,gc --duration 12 --warmup 2
```

Statuses distinguish launch failures from tuning failures. Missing BIOS,
firmware, keys, or proprietary emulator runtime files are reported as
`blocked-missing-runtime`; frame pacing failures are reported as
`fail-performance` with a recommendation such as lowering NNEDI3 quality,
falling back to sharp-bilinear, or lowering emulator-native internal
resolution. FBNeo logs many harmless `No romset found` search-path probes
before finding an arcade set; those probes are not treated as missing runtime
files once FBNeo reports a found romset or `No missing files, proceeding`.
For fast-scrolling FBNeo games such as OutRun, keep NNEDI3 as the default 2D
arcade policy and use per-content fallbacks in this order:
`nnedi3-balanced`, `nnedi3-fast`, `sharp-bilinear-prescale`, then `no-shader`.

## RetroArch

RetroArch is built with explicit cores for arcade, 8-bit, 16-bit, handheld,
PC Engine/SuperGrafx, PlayStation, Saturn, Dreamcast, N64, DS, PSP/PS2
fallback coverage, and 3DS fallback coverage. Managed config is written under
`/srv/emulation/config/retroarch`.

Default ES-DE mappings now use RetroAchievements-aligned cores where practical:

- NES/FDS: FCEUmm.
- PC Engine / PC Engine CD / SuperGrafx: Beetle SuperGrafx.
- GB/GBC: Gambatte.
- GBA: mGBA.
- SNES: Snes9x.
- N64: Mupen64Plus-Next.
- DS: DeSmuME.
- Dreamcast: Flycast.
- PlayStation: Beetle PSX HW.

Standalone defaults are PCSX2 for PS2, PPSSPP for PSP, Dolphin for GameCube
and Wii, and Azahar for 3DS when available.

Defaults:

- Vulkan video driver.
- PipeWire audio driver.
- Saves, states, screenshots, and logs outside ROM folders.
- Config save on exit disabled.
- Upstream joypad autoconfig installed when available.
- Per-core option files live under
  `/srv/emulation/config/retroarch/core-options`.
- Per-system override files live under
  `/srv/emulation/config/retroarch/system-overrides`.

## Shaders

The module packages current upstream RetroArch shader trees and exposes them in
RetroArch's expected layout:

- `shaders_slang`
- `shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel`
- `shaders_glsl`
- `shaders_cg`

Default shader profile is `nnedi3-clean`. The installed runtime profiles are:

- `nnedi3-clean`
- `nnedi3-quality`
- `nnedi3-balanced`
- `nnedi3-fast`
- `sharp-bilinear-prescale`
- `sharp-bilinear-simple`
- `pixel-aa-fast`
- `scalefx-aa-fast`
- `xbrz-freescale`
- `no-shader`
- `megabezel-auto`
- `megabezel-standard`
- `megabezel-potato`
- `megabezel-passthrough`
- `sharp-clean`
- `integer-raw`
- `performance`

NNEDI3 is used for clean 2D upscaling by default. Handheld systems use lighter
NNEDI3 where appropriate, 3D-heavy RetroArch systems default to no shader or a
light sharp-bilinear profile, and Mega Bezel remains installed and selectable
but is no longer the default. `retroarch-shader-smoke-test` writes
`/srv/emulation/config/retroarch/shader-status.json`; the launcher uses that
marker to fall back from missing NNEDI3/Mega Bezel paths to sharp or no-shader
profiles.

## Controllers And Bluetooth

The primary controller path is four Nintendo Switch Pro-style controllers
exposed as `057e:2009` over Bluetooth or USB. The host enables BlueZ
experimental behavior, `hid-nintendo`, Switch Pro/8BitDo Switch-mode udev
access, and disables USB autosuspend for the known controller identities.
Boomer's live radio stack is the MediaTek MT7921/MT7961 combo device
(`14c3:7961` Wi-Fi plus `0e8d:7961` USB Bluetooth), so the managed defaults
also disable MT7921e ASPM and NetworkManager Wi-Fi power save.

Boomer prefers Bluetooth BR/EDR mode because Switch Pro controllers, Wiimotes,
and normal A2DP headphone audio use classic Bluetooth. This intentionally
reduces unused LE/ISO activity for the four-controller couch setup. BLE-only
accessories are not the primary target.
`controller-bluetooth-low-latency` removes Bluetooth `SNIFF` low-power policy
from the adapter and connected Switch Pro controller links after boot and
reconnects. This trades controller battery life for lower input latency during
multiplayer sessions. Startup `btmgmt` tuning is deliberately bounded per
command so a busy adapter cannot stall controller services for long.

Player assignment is managed by the ES-DE `Bluetooth Settings` TUI. Runtime
state is stored at:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/controllers/player-order.json
```

`controller-leds` watches Switch-style Bluetooth controller identities from
BlueZ and supported USB HID input nodes from the kernel, then applies
Switch-style player LED counts through sysfs according to the saved player
slots when that LED interface exists. It writes only changed LED files at a
bounded half-second cadence,
because each sysfs LED write sends a Nintendo output subcommand over Bluetooth
or USB HID. One-shot applies still force a single pattern refresh after explicit
assignment or pairing. Bluetooth connection truth comes from BlueZ, not stale
local HID nodes, so a disconnected Bluetooth controller is not kept alive only
because its old `/sys` input device has not disappeared yet. If a controller
identity does not expose LED sysfs entries, logical assignment still remains
stable. Some 8BitDo USB wired modes expose `2dc8:301a` through `hid-generic`;
that mode is tracked while connected as an input-only
`USB:<vendor>:<product>:<uniq>` player identity but does not expose Nintendo
player LED sysfs controls.
Connected controllers are compacted into the lowest open player slots while
preserving their relative order, so if P2 turns off P3/P4 slide down and the
returning controller lands at the end.
Controller add events and BlueZ `Connected` property changes trigger a debounced
one-shot reconcile after the connect/disconnect burst settles, and the
background reconcile uses a short D-Bus polling cadence with a lock so one-shot
and loop updates cannot race against each other. One-shot applies update the
background state marker, and LED writes are limited to entries that actually
need to change and serialized at a half-second cadence so hid-nintendo output
reports are not flooded.
The one-shot apply is not start-limited and briefly waits for a reconnecting
controller's LED sysfs path before relying on later retries.
`controller-autoconnect` polls at a low cadence with short bounded connect
attempts, uses BlueZ D-Bus state for discovery, reconnects paired Switch Pro
controllers serially, re-checks live connected state before each attempt, and
leaves headphones and other accessories alone.

Controller shortcuts follow a Rocknix-style Switch layout. Select/Minus is the
hotkey modifier, Select+X opens emulator quick menus where supported, and
Star/Home is treated as a controller-local turbo button when the firmware
exposes it at all. Square/Capture opens native console Home screens only where
that binding is explicitly configured, such as Dolphin's Wii profile, and
otherwise does nothing. Select held plus a double Start press asks the active
emulator process group to exit normally, then force-kills that process group
after 5 seconds if it does not close. RetroArch maps Select/Minus hotkeys to
save/load, reset, FPS, screenshot, and fast-forward actions, and D-pad-only
RetroArch systems also accept left-stick D-pad input. The N64 RetroArch
override remaps Mupen64Plus so physical Switch A sends N64 A, physical Switch
B sends N64 B, and physical Switch X/Y stay unbound.

`joycond` and `joycond-cemuhook` stay installed for manual experiments but are
not started by default. The normal path uses the kernel `hid-nintendo` devices
directly so there is no extra userspace daemon competing for controller output
reports.

Diagnostics:

```text
/srv/emulation/logs/controller-bluetooth-health.log
/srv/emulation/logs/controller-bluetooth-latency.log
/srv/emulation/logs/tools/bluetooth-pairing.log
controller-bluetooth-diagnostics 20
```

The diagnostics command writes a timestamped summary plus a short `btmon`
capture under `/srv/emulation/logs/bluetooth-diagnostics/`. Full BlueZ and
`hid-nintendo` debug logging is kept as an on-demand diagnostic path only,
because continuously logging every controller HID report creates unnecessary
load during normal four-controller play.
`bluetoothd` runs with a small safe CPU scheduling boost, and system D-Bus gets
a smaller CPU weight bump because BlueZ control events use D-Bus. Do not enable
realtime scheduling or IRQ pinning by default; the live kernel already gives
Bluetooth HCI workers and IRQ threads elevated priority.

Wi-Fi stays available for SSH, but NetworkManager Wi-Fi profiles are constrained
to 5 GHz by default to avoid 2.4 GHz contention with Bluetooth. The ES-DE
`Wi-Fi Settings` TUI can allow 2.4 GHz after showing a Bluetooth performance
warning. Do not blacklist shared Wi-Fi/Bluetooth kernel modules until live
hardware confirms the adapter split.

## ES-DE Tools

The ES-DE Tools system exposes large-font terminal TUIs for `Bluetooth Settings`,
`Wi-Fi Settings`, and `Controller Maps`, plus restart, reboot, and shutdown.
The settings TUIs use a dark two-column layout: actions on the left,
selected-action status and details on the right. They support keyboard and
controller navigation from the couch. Bluetooth status shows whether Boomer is
scanning for nearby devices, but does not expose host-only discoverable or
pairable fields. `Show Paired` sits directly under status and previews all
paired devices in the right pane.
`Controller Maps` uses the same two-pane layout with a slightly smaller font.
Each page keeps a two-column button map at the top and common hotkeys below it
so the right pane fits without ASCII controller diagrams.
Non-status actions show only concise action help in the right pane so long
status blocks do not crowd the menu. Player assignment accepts keyboard input as
a player device, and B/Esc backs out before any assignment is made. Under the
ES-DE Gamescope session they launch through Xwayland `xterm`, with `foot` kept
as a pure Wayland fallback. Bluetooth pairing uses a 10-second non-interactive
BlueZ scan, parses newly discovered devices from the live scan output, hides
already connected devices, filters the picker to likely audio/controller/HID
peripherals, and shows whether each candidate is already paired. The pair
command registers a BlueZ agent for that command instead of relying on a stale
interactive session, and rechecks BlueZ state before treating a reported
pair/connect error as fatal. Keyboard input is handled by the terminal, while
the raw `/dev/input` reader is limited to real controller navigation devices so
Switch Pro IMU motion data and analog-stick idle noise do not move the menu.
Player assignment drains pending input before listening and accepts only a real
button/key press, so stale stick navigation cannot move a controller to another
slot. `Restart ES-DE` runs through a dedicated delayed system service outside
the frontend process tree; in kiosk mode it restarts the greetd-managed session,
and in console mode it restarts `emulation-session.service`.
Launch diagnostics are written under `/srv/emulation/logs/tools/`. Helper
scripts for audio, display, RetroArch, scraping, launch logs, ROM coverage,
smoke tests, and performance tests remain available on disk for SSH or
background use, but are not shown in the ES-DE menu.

These tools are exposed as an ES-DE `Tools` system. Upstream ES-DE does not
provide a stable Batocera-style API for arbitrary native main-menu actions; that
would require a maintained ES-DE source build or patch.

## Scraping Secrets

The scraper secret unit is `emulation-scraper-secrets` with:

- `SCREENSCRAPER_USER`
- `SCREENSCRAPER_PASS`

The generated projection is:

```text
/run/ghostship-secrets/emulation-scraper.env
```

`secrets/recipients.nix` gives `emulation-runtime` to operator edit keys and
the Boomer host key. Rekey the secret after changing recipients so the machine
can decrypt it at runtime.

## RetroAchievements Secrets

The RetroAchievements secret unit is `emulation-retroachievements-secrets` with:

- `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_USER`
- `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_PASS`

The generated projection is:

```text
/run/ghostship-secrets/emulation-retroachievements.env
```

`render-retroachievements-settings` writes RetroArch's runtime
`cheevos_*` settings to:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/retroarch/retroachievements.cfg
```

RetroArch receives that file through `run-emulator` append config. Standalone
emulator achievement login remains `manual-login-required` until each live
config format is confirmed on Boomer; the status file records that deliberately
instead of guessing at credential keys.

## Verification On Hardware

After SSH access exists:

1. Verify `emulation-scraper-secrets` and
   `emulation-retroachievements-secrets` decrypt and project credentials.
2. Verify the label-based Btrfs mounts for `/` and
   `/srv/emulation/roms`.
3. Boot to the tty, run `esde-preflight`, then launch ES-DE with
   `start-esde` and confirm Art Book Next appears.
4. Run `audio-route` and confirm HDMI audio on each physical HDMI port you
   intend to use.
5. Pair all four controllers in Switch mode and verify connection-order player
   assignment.
6. Run `retroarch-shader-smoke-test`.
7. Launch one game per emulator family and inspect
   `/srv/emulation/logs/launches`.
8. Run `display-profile --matrix-test`, `rom-coverage-check`,
   `smoke-rom-select`, and `smoke-test --dry-run`.
9. Test 1080p, 1440p, 4K, and ultrawide displays and confirm fixed-aspect
   content stays centered and unstretched.
