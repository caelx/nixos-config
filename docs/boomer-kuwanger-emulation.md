# Boomer Kuwanger Emulation PC

`boomer-kuwanger` is managed as a dedicated NixOS emulation box through the
split `modules/emulation/` module set. The host boots directly into ES-DE under
Gamescope through the `kiosk` user. `start-esde` remains available as a manual
launch helper for maintenance sessions. It keeps writable emulator state under
`/srv/emulation` and launches every configured system through the repo-managed
`run-emulator` wrapper.

## Runtime Layout

- `/srv/emulation/roms`: local ROM root, mounted from the 4 TB Btrfs filesystem
  labeled `roms`.
- `/srv/emulation/bios`: BIOS, firmware, keys, and other user-provided files.
- `/srv/emulation/saves`, `/srv/emulation/states`, `/srv/emulation/screenshots`:
  runtime output outside ROM folders.
- `/srv/emulation/config`: emulator overrides, display policy, RetroArch base
  config, controller state, and TeknoParrot prefix state.
- `/srv/emulation/es-de`: ES-DE appdata, settings, themes, custom systems, and
  scraped media.
- `/srv/emulation/logs`: launch, RetroArch, controller, and tool logs.
- `/home/kiosk/Emulation`: symlink to `/srv/emulation`.

The Boomer host config uses label-based mounts. The emulation module's optional
`ghostship.emulation.romDisk.uuid` remains available for non-Boomer deployments,
but Boomer itself expects the installed disks to use the labels below.

## Disk Layout

`/dev/nvme0n1` is the 512 GB OS disk:

- `p1`: 1 GiB FAT32, label `BOOT`, mounted at `/boot`.
- `p2`: 32 GiB swap, label `swap`.
- `p3`: remaining space Btrfs, label `nixos`, mounted at `/`.

`/dev/nvme1n1` is the 4 TB ROM disk:

- `p1`: whole disk Btrfs, label `roms`, mounted at `/srv/emulation/roms`.

Btrfs mounts use `noatime`, `compress=zstd:1`, and `discard=async`. The ROM
mount intentionally avoids `autodefrag`.

## Frontend

ES-DE is mandatory; Pegasus is not used. The module installs ES-DE 3.4.1 from
the official AppImage package, sets `ESDE_APPDATA_DIR=/srv/emulation/es-de`,
installs Art Book Next, and generates:

- `/srv/emulation/es-de/custom_systems/es_systems.xml`
- `/srv/emulation/es-de/custom_systems/es_find_rules.xml`
- `/srv/emulation/es-de/settings/es_settings.xml`

`sync-esde-config` creates or refreshes the appdata skeleton at boot.
Additional setup scripts sync RetroArch, ES-DE tools, and standalone emulator
config scaffolds before the frontend starts. Existing ES-DE settings are
preserved after first creation so runtime UI changes can survive rebuilds,
except for managed defaults such as theme, systems sorting, display clock,
folders-on-top, and controller UI hints. Systems are sorted by manufacturer,
hardware type, and release year, and hidden files/games are disabled so staging
folders such as Switch `.updates` and `.dlc` stay out of the game list. ES-DE
menu input is available from all connected controllers, not only player 1.
Boomer runs in
Hawaii standard time and the managed Art Book Next theme package uses ES-DE's
supported `%H:%M` clock format so the hour renders reliably. True 12-hour time
needs ES-DE formatter support beyond the official AppImage's theme tokens.

During bootstrap, use:

- `esde-preflight` to check DRM, Vulkan, ES-DE appdata, and service
  readiness.
- `start-esde` to launch ES-DE manually under Gamescope on the RX 6650M and
  the currently connected HDMI/DP output.
- `esde-status` to inspect the active session and latest logs.
- `stop-esde` to return control to `getty@tty1`.

ES-DE game launches reuse the frontend Gamescope session. Direct tty launches
still wrap emulators in DRM Gamescope, but nested Gamescope is skipped when
`DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is already present.

The ES-DE AppImage runs under bubblewrap, so the systemd session clears Linux
capabilities before launching Gamescope. Keep that service hardening in place
unless ES-DE is rebuilt from source.

## ROMs

The module maps every ROM folder discovered under `/mnt/z/Library/ROMs/roms`
into ES-DE. On boot, if a matching `/mnt/z` source folder is visible and
`/srv/emulation/roms/<folder>` is missing, the setup service creates a symlink.
Otherwise it creates an empty local folder, which should be hidden by the real
`roms` mount on the installed machine.

RetroArch is preferred when a usable, RetroAchievements-compatible libretro
core exists. Standalone emulators are installed where they are the better
operational or RetroAchievements target: Dolphin, Cemu, xemu,
Ryubing/Ryujinx, Azahar, PCSX2, PPSSPP, Supermodel, GZDoom, PICO-8, and
TeknoParrot free.

Ryubing uses the official Canary Linux x64 release, not nixpkgs' stable
`ryubing` package. The current pin follows the official latest redirect at
`https://update.ryujinx.app/latest/canary` and is recorded in
`modules/emulation/ryubing-canary-pin.nix`. Run this before a Boomer rebuild to
advance the pin when upstream publishes a new Canary:

```sh
scripts/update-ryubing-canary /root/nixos-config
```

Nix still needs a fixed hash, so the build itself stays reproducible; the
updater is the intentional step that converts "latest Canary" into a Nix pin.
Switch homebrew `.nro` entries can keep their asset folders beside the launched
file. When `run-emulator` sees a sibling `data/` directory, it links that
directory into Ryubing's emulated SD card at
`/srv/emulation/xdg/config/Ryujinx/sdcard/data`, replacing only an existing
symlink. Proprietary keys stay operator-managed under
`/srv/emulation/bios/switch` and are exposed to Ryubing's runtime system
directory at launch. Firmware also stays operator-managed in that BIOS folder:
`run-emulator` selects the newest local `Firmware*.zip`, extracts its NCA files
into Ryubing's `bis/system/Contents/registered` directory when needed, and
writes a marker recording the source path, resolved path, hash, and file count.

`run-emulator` also converges Ryubing's `Config.json` before each Switch launch
so Boomer uses Vulkan on the RX 6650M dGPU, docked mode, fullscreen launch, 2x
internal resolution, 16x anisotropic filtering, shader cache, SDL3 audio, SDL3
controller input for up to four connected players using Ryubing-native stable
SDL3 controller IDs, and Ryubing's native scaling/filtering. The Switch hotkey
broker maps Minus+X to `F4` for Ryubing UI, Minus+A to `F8` for screenshot,
and Square/Capture to `F5` for pause.

Ryubing update and DLC packages stay as operator-managed NSP files beside the
Switch ROM folder, but under hidden staging directories so ES-DE does not list
them as games:

```text
Nintendo - Switch (2017)/
  Game [0100000000000000].xci
  .updates/
    Game Update [0100000000000800] [v123].nsp
  .dlc/
    Game DLC [0100000000001001].nsp
```

Before each Ryubing launch, `run-emulator` matches the launched base title ID to
direct NSP files in sibling `.updates/` and `.dlc/` directories. Filename title
IDs and `[v...]` versions are the fast path. If a package filename does not
include a title ID, the launcher inspects its NSP metadata with `nstool` and
caches the result under Ryubing's config directory. Matching updates are written
to `games/<base-title-id>/updates.json` with the highest version selected;
matching DLC is written to `games/<base-title-id>/dlc.json` with all content
enabled. Existing manual Ryubing entries are preserved while their files still
exist.

## GZDoom

The Doom system uses the source library folder `Fantasy - GZDoom (2005)` in
ES-DE and accepts normal WAD/PK3 files plus Batocera-style `.gzdoom` launchers.
A `.gzdoom` launcher is a text file with one non-empty GZDoom argument line,
for example:

```text
-iwad assets/Doom II - Hell on Earth/DOOM2.WAD -file assets/SIGIL/SIGIL_v1_21.wad
```

`run-emulator` parses that line with shell-style quoting, does not execute it
through a shell, and launches GZDoom from the `.gzdoom` file's directory so
relative asset paths work. Keep assets under the Doom ROM folder and put the
human-facing launchers at the top level for cleaner ES-DE scraping.
Every GZDoom launch executes the managed
`/srv/emulation/config/emulators/gzdoom/boomer-controls.cfg` file so joystick
input is enabled. Boomer reset back to the first repo Doom control layout from
`e0e6880`, then started applying targeted overrides from the current in-game
8BitDo Ultimate 2C probe. The setup script clears stale `Doom.Bindings`,
`Doom.DoubleBindings`, and `Doom.AutomapBindings` sections that earlier broken
attempts wrote, then leaves GZDoom to regenerate its own default button map.
`boomer-controls.cfg` runs after that and overrides the observed bad generic
`Joy*`/`POV1*` defaults. The only GZDoom package patch kept is the menu A/B
swap.

The setup script still writes GZDoom's `[Joy:JS:*]` SDL axis map so left X/Y are
strafe/forward, right X/Y are yaw/pitch, `Axis3scale` is `0.25`, and unused
axes cannot drive the view upward on launch.

The current correction pass uses this format: physical control -> current
GZDoom key -> target binding.

| Physical control | Current/probed key | Target binding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B | `Joy1` (confirmed) | `+jump` |
| A | `Joy2` (confirmed) | `+use` |
| X | `Joy3` (confirmed) | `crouch` |
| Y | `Joy4` (was jump; vanilla Doom may show no reload action) | `+reload` |
| L1 / L | `Joy6` (was still weapon switch) | `+user1` |
| R1 / R | `Joy7` (was pause) | `+user2` |
| L2 / ZL | `Joy8` (was menu) | `+altattack` |
| R2 / ZR | `Joy9` / `Joy14` or trigger axis fallback | `+attack` |
| Select / `-` | `Joy10` (confirmed; was crouch) | `togglemap` |
| Start / `+` | `Joy11` / `Joy12` or `Pad_Start` alias fallback | `menu_main` |
| D-pad left/right | `POV1Left` / `POV1Right` (confirmed) | `weapprev` / `weapnext` |
| D-pad up/down | `POV1Up` (was map) / `POV1Down` | `invprev` / `invuse` |
| L4 / R4 | not yet observed as unique events | unbound until proven |

The cfg also keeps physical-label `Pad_*`, shoulder, trigger, and D-pad alias
fallbacks with the same target layout in case GZDoom routes a future controller
through named controller events instead of generic `Joy*` events.

### Switch Pro Raw Input Probe

The current Boomer controller baseline was probed on April 30, 2026 from
`/dev/input/event16` (`Pro Controller`) with the raw log saved on Boomer at
`/srv/emulation/logs/controller-probes/raw-20260430-135115.log`.
SDL's live controller mapping was also probed at
`/srv/emulation/logs/controller-probes/sdl-20260430-140039.log`; it reported
`a:b0,b:b1,x:b2,y:b3,back:b4,start:b6,leftshoulder:b9,rightshoulder:b10,lefttrigger:a4,righttrigger:a5,dp*:h0`.
This table is the kernel event layer, not the authoritative GZDoom `JoyN`
binding map. The available probe did not show unique L4/R4 events.

| Physical control | Linux event |
| --- | --- |
| B / South | `EV_KEY 304 BTN_SOUTH` |
| A / East | `EV_KEY 305 BTN_EAST` |
| X / North | `EV_KEY 307 BTN_NORTH` |
| Y / West | `EV_KEY 308 BTN_WEST` |
| Square / Capture | `EV_KEY 309 BTN_Z` |
| L1 / L | `EV_KEY 310 BTN_TL` |
| R1 / R | `EV_KEY 311 BTN_TR` |
| L2 / ZL | `EV_KEY 312 BTN_TL2` |
| R2 / ZR | `EV_KEY 313 BTN_TR2` |
| Select / `-` | `EV_KEY 314 BTN_SELECT` |
| Start / `+` | `EV_KEY 315 BTN_START` |
| Left stick click | `EV_KEY 317 BTN_THUMBL` |
| Right stick click | `EV_KEY 318 BTN_THUMBR` |
| D-pad left/right | `EV_ABS 16 ABS_HAT0X`, `-1` left and `1` right |
| D-pad up/down | `EV_ABS 17 ABS_HAT0Y`, `-1` up and `1` down |
| Left stick X/Y | `EV_ABS 0 ABS_X`, `EV_ABS 1 ABS_Y` |
| Right stick X/Y | `EV_ABS 3 ABS_RX`, `EV_ABS 4 ABS_RY` |
| Star / Home | Not observed in this probe; may be controller-local |

## BIOS, Firmware, And Keys

Keep all proprietary runtime files out of the repo:

- Imported BIOS source mirror: `/srv/emulation/bios/systems`
- Switch firmware and keys: `/srv/emulation/bios/switch`
- PlayStation/PlayStation 2 BIOS: `/srv/emulation/bios`
- Sega CD, Saturn, Neo Geo CD, PC Engine CD BIOS: `/srv/emulation/bios`
- Xbox MCPX, BIOS, and HDD image material for xemu: `/srv/emulation/bios/xbox`

The Nix module creates Xemu's machine settings at
`/srv/emulation/xdg/share/xemu/xemu/xemu.toml`, disables Xemu's welcome wizard
and menubar, and launches Xemu with that config explicitly. Keep
`mcpx_1.0.bin`, `Complex_4627.bin`, and `xbox_hdd.qcow2` under
`/srv/emulation/bios/xbox`. Name launchable Xbox images with the `.xiso`
suffix and keep redump backups from ending in `.iso` so ES-DE does not list
the unbootable video partition dumps.
Current smoke coverage has confirmed these BIOS-gated files are still needed
for the selected disc tests: `scph5500.bin` for Japanese PlayStation,
`mpr-17933.bin` for Saturn, and a valid Neo Geo CD BIOS set for NeoCD.

## PICO-8

The official PICO-8 zip is consumed with `pkgs.requireFile`:

- Expected source: `/mnt/c/Users/james/Downloads/pico-8_0.2.7_amd64.zip`
- Hash: `sha256-1alyii0bc9r9j2519q3jhxn8xazrcffy0kl8k07mnn208y2wxwpd`

The package wraps the Linux PICO-8 binary with `steam-run` so it can launch on
NixOS without committing proprietary files.

PICO-8 uses SDL's X11 video path on Boomer, so `run-emulator` adds an explicit
Gamescope Xwayland server for PICO-8 launches. The launcher also passes an
explicit `-home /srv/emulation/config/emulators/pico8` path and rewrites
`config.txt` plus `sdl_controllers.txt` before each launch so controller
mapping, cart data, screenshots, and GIF output stay in managed emulation
paths.

`pico8-hotkeys` is the default ES-DE launcher. It starts the standalone hotkey
broker and injects PICO-8's own keyboard shortcuts: Minus + X opens the pause
menu, Minus + B sends `CTRL-R`, Minus + A sends `CTRL-6`, Minus + Y sends
`CTRL-9`, and Minus + R2 is logged as unavailable because PICO-8 has no
fast-forward hotkey. Plain `pico8` remains available as a fallback alternate.
Current smoke coverage uses `POOM.png` from the PICO-8 library as the heavier
test cart.

## TeknoParrot Free

Only the free TeknoParrot path is scaffolded. No premium unlocks, bypasses,
commercial game files, or third-party patch packs are managed.

Place official free TeknoParrot files under:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/teknoparrot/TeknoParrot
```

The wrapper uses a dedicated Wine prefix at:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/teknoparrot/prefix
```

The wrapper seeds that prefix with the Wine Mono MSI version expected by the
packaged Wine build before launching `TeknoParrotUi.exe`, because TeknoParrotUi
is a .NET application.

ES-DE lists `.xml` TeknoParrot profile files. `run-emulator` matches the
selected XML to TeknoParrot's official `GameProfiles` entry, copies the selected
profile into `UserProfiles` using that official profile name, switches to the
TeknoParrot install directory, and launches `TeknoParrotUi.exe --profile` under
Wine. The wrapper also seeds `ParrotData.xml` with the first-run setup and
policy prompts completed, update/icon downloads disabled, hardware acceleration
disabled, and silent mode enabled for kiosk launches. Keep copied game payloads
under hidden `.assets/` directories beside those XML profiles. Profiles should
use Wine-visible game paths, for example a `Z:\srv\...` path generated with
`winepath -w`. The runtime does not provide proprietary game assets, premium
unlocks, dongle bypasses, or patch packs.

Current After Burner Climax status: the launcher now reaches TeknoParrotUi's
game-running handoff with the official `abcELF2.xml` profile id, but the
remaining live blocker is `ElfLdr2/BudgieLoader.exe` exiting before it starts
the native `abc` process. Wine staging 11.1 reproduced that as a loader stack
crash; GE-Proton 10-33 inside `steam-run`, with Xalia disabled and 32-bit plus
64-bit FreeType exposed, avoided the stack crash but still exited before
spawning `abc`. The operator-managed live ROM folder was removed from Boomer
while this work is paused, so ES-DE should not list an After Burner Climax
TeknoParrot game until ROM content is restored.

## Display And Aspect Scaling

`display-profile` discovers connected DRM outputs first, prefers the RX 6650M,
supports either HDMI port, and falls back to Wayland/X11 resolution probes when
needed. It emits JSON with the selected connector, DRM card, output size,
render size, aspect class, viewport recommendations, and Gamescope arguments.
`run-emulator` wraps emulator launches in Gamescope by default.

The default policy:

- Run ES-DE at native display resolution.
- Never use Gamescope FSR.
- Keep `render_width`/`render_height` equal to the active display output.
- Use emulator-native internal resolution scaling for standalone and 3D
  systems.
- Use RetroArch Slang shaders for clean 2D scaling.
- Center fixed-aspect systems on ultrawide displays unless a native widescreen
  emulator mode is selected later.

Runtime override knobs can live in `/srv/emulation/config/display.env` for
manual testing, but durable policy changes belong in the Nix module.
Run `display-profile --matrix-test` to verify native render/output sizing,
`fsr=false`, and aspect-safe viewport recommendations without display hardware.

## Audio

Audio uses PipeWire with Pulse compatibility. `audio-route` runs from the
frontend session, emulator launcher, and user service to prefer the AMD
Navi 21/23 HDMI/DP audio card over USB audio adapters. It does not hardcode one
physical HDMI port; it asks PipeWire which AMD HDMI/DP profile is currently
`available`, sets that card profile, and makes the matching HDMI sink default.
If `Bluetooth Settings` selects a connected Bluetooth audio sink, `audio-route`
honors that preference and falls back to HDMI when the Bluetooth sink is absent.
PipeWire is configured for stable emulator audio rather than ultra-low latency:
48 kHz graph rate, 1024 default quantum, 512 minimum quantum, 2048 maximum
quantum, and matching Pulse request/tlength defaults. SDL3 emulator launches
prefer `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=pipewire` with 1024 sample frames and 48 kHz F32
audio; SDL2-only paths may use the legacy SDL audio driver variable, but it is
not set globally.

Run `audio-route` from SSH to inspect and repair the route.

## Smoke ROMs

Smoke ROM tooling lives under `/srv/emulation/smoke-roms` and
`/srv/emulation/config/smoke/roms.json`.

- `smoke-rom-select`: selects up to three top-level ROM entries per non-empty
  source system, preferring demanding known titles and otherwise choosing the
  largest entries.
- `smoke-rom-sync`: copies the selected entries into the smoke ROM tree.
- `smoke-test`: launches each selected entry through `run-emulator`, with
  Gamescope, GameMode, and MangoHud logging.
- `smoke-report`: summarizes the latest test run.

The smoke harness is intended for target-display validation. A `--dry-run`
mode prints the exact `run-emulator` calls without launching games. Root-run
smoke tests re-exec as `kiosk` on tty1 with cleared capability sets so
`steam-run`/bubblewrap-based emulators, including PICO-8, launch the same way
they do from ES-DE. On kiosk-mode hosts, the wrapper stops `greetd` only while
the test owns tty1 and restores `greetd` afterward so the console returns to
ES-DE instead of a login prompt.

The runtime launcher does not transform ROMs. If a smoke entry fails because
the selected copied entry is an archive or folder shape that the emulator will
not open, manually extract only that smoke copy and point `roms.json` at the
playable file. The final ROM set should already be stored in the launchable
shape expected by the target emulator.

## Performance Testing

Performance tooling builds on the smoke ROM manifest and always launches
through `run-emulator`, so Gamescope, GameMode, HDMI audio routing, display
policy, RetroArch global shader preset, and emulator logging follow the same
path as normal play. Gamescope FSR remains disabled for every run.

Runtime state:

- `/srv/emulation/config/perf/policy.json`: mode defaults, thresholds, the
  global shader baseline, scaling profiles, and tuning notes.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/context.json`: package versions, kernel,
  display profile, audio summary, Vulkan summary, and mapped systems.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/results.jsonl`: one JSON result per ROM
  and profile.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/recommended-changes.json`: proposed
  tuning changes only; nothing is applied automatically.
- `/srv/emulation/logs/perf/<run-id>/mangohud/*.csv`: raw MangoHud frame data.

Commands:

- `perf-test --quick`: one ROM per mapped system, 75 seconds each with a
  15-second warmup.
- `perf-test --overnight`: up to three ROMs per mapped system, 180 seconds each
  with a 30-second warmup.
- `perf-test --shader-matrix`: RetroArch systems only, validating the global
  shader preset path.
- `perf-test --scaling-matrix`: standalone systems only, recording baseline,
  quality, and performance scaling profiles for emulator-native tuning.
- `perf-test --single <system> <rom>`: focused debug run for one ROM.
- `perf-report`: latest report table with average FPS, 1% low, p99 frame time,
  status, and recommendations.
- `perf-compare`: compares two runs and flags >3% FPS regressions or >2 ms p99
  frame-time regressions.
- Root-run performance tests use the same capability-cleared tty re-exec path
  as the smoke harness so fullscreen Gamescope launches match the production
  kiosk session.
- `perf-profile current`: shows the global RetroArch shader preset and current
  standalone runtime scaling policy files.

Use `--duration`, `--warmup`, and `--systems` for short validation loops, for
example:

```sh
perf-test --shader-matrix --systems nes,pcengine,gba,snes,fbneo --duration 12 --warmup 2
perf-test --scaling-matrix --systems psp,gc --duration 12 --warmup 2
```

Statuses distinguish launch failures from tuning failures. Missing BIOS,
firmware, keys, or proprietary emulator runtime files are reported as
`blocked-missing-runtime`; frame pacing failures are reported as
`fail-performance` with a recommendation to inspect core-specific
dynarec/internal-resolution options or lower emulator-native internal
resolution. FBNeo logs many harmless `No romset found` search-path probes
before finding an arcade set; those probes are not treated as missing runtime
files once FBNeo reports a found romset or `No missing files, proceeding`.
For RetroArch shader changes, edit the single managed `global.slangp` preset
instead of adding generated shader profile configs.

## RetroArch

RetroArch is built with explicit cores for arcade, 8-bit, 16-bit, handheld,
PC Engine/SuperGrafx, PlayStation, Saturn, Dreamcast, N64, DS, PSP/PS2
fallback coverage, and 3DS fallback coverage. Managed config is written under
`/srv/emulation/config/retroarch`.

RetroAchievements are enabled by default for RetroArch cores when the
`emulation-retroachievements-secrets` credentials are present. The default
profile keeps hardcore mode off, leaves verbose achievement messages on,
starts sessions with all achievements active locally, and enables badges,
unlock/mastery visibility, rich presence, automatic unlock screenshots, and
unlock sounds.

Default ES-DE mappings now use RetroAchievements-aligned cores where practical:

- NES/FDS: FCEUmm.
- PC Engine / PC Engine CD / SuperGrafx: Beetle SuperGrafx.
- GB/GBC: Gambatte.
- GBA: mGBA.
- SNES: Snes9x.
- N64: Mupen64Plus-Next with GLideN64, 3x native resolution, and the global
  RetroArch shader preset.
- DS: DeSmuME.
- Dreamcast: Flycast.
- PlayStation: Beetle PSX HW.

Standalone defaults are PCSX2 for PS2, PPSSPP for PSP, Dolphin for GameCube
and Wii, and Azahar for 3DS when available.

PCSX2 is managed under `/srv/emulation/xdg/config/PCSX2`. `run-emulator`
generates its `inis/PCSX2.ini` before each PS2 launch so the setup wizard stays
disabled, the BIOS search directory is `/srv/emulation/bios`, the PS2 ROM
folder is indexed, and saves, states, screenshots, logs, cache, patches,
cheats, textures, and game settings stay under the managed emulation roots.
The Boomer default uses PCSX2's Vulkan renderer at 3x native resolution and
launches games with `-batch -fullscreen` so ES-DE starts directly into the game
without manual config prompts. PCSX2 does not boot `.m3u` playlists directly on
Boomer, so `run-emulator` resolves a PS2 `.m3u` to its first non-comment disc
entry and passes that real disc path to PCSX2. `sync-emulator-configs` seeds
`Soulcalibur III (USA).m3u` beside the existing CHD when that ROM is present.
PCSX2 port 1 multitap is enabled by default for four-player games, with Pad1-4
mapped to SDL controller slots 0-3. MTVU is enabled while EE cycle rate and
cycle skip stay neutral for compatibility.

Defaults:

- Vulkan video driver.
- PipeWire audio driver.
- Saves, states, screenshots, and logs outside ROM folders.
- Config save on exit disabled.
- Upstream joypad autoconfig installed when available.
- Per-core option files live under
  `/srv/emulation/xdg/config/retroarch/config/<Core>/<Core>.opt`.
- The global shader preset lives at
  `/srv/emulation/xdg/config/retroarch/config/global.slangp`.

## Shaders

The module packages current upstream RetroArch shader trees and exposes them in
RetroArch's expected layout:

- `shaders_slang`
- `shaders_slang/bezel/Mega_Bezel`
- `shaders_glsl`
- `shaders_cg`

RetroArch uses one managed global preset:
`/srv/emulation/xdg/config/retroarch/config/global.slangp`. The module does
not generate shader profile `.cfg` files, per-system shader overrides, or a
shader policy file.

## Controllers And Bluetooth

The primary controller path is four Nintendo Switch Pro-style controllers
exposed as `057e:2009` over Bluetooth or USB. The host enables BlueZ
experimental behavior, `hid-nintendo`, Switch Pro/8BitDo Switch-mode udev
access, and disables USB autosuspend for the known controller identities.
Boomer's live radio stack is the MediaTek MT7921/MT7961 combo device
(`14c3:7961` Wi-Fi plus `0e8d:7961` USB Bluetooth), so the managed defaults
also disable MT7921e ASPM and NetworkManager Wi-Fi power save.

Boomer prefers Bluetooth BR/EDR mode because Switch Pro controllers, Wiimotes,
and normal A2DP headphone audio use classic Bluetooth. This intentionally
reduces unused LE/ISO activity for the four-controller couch setup. BLE-only
accessories are not the primary target.
`controller-bluetooth-low-latency` removes Bluetooth `SNIFF` low-power policy
from the adapter and connected Switch Pro controller links after boot and
reconnects. This trades controller battery life for lower input latency during
multiplayer sessions. Startup `btmgmt` tuning is deliberately bounded per
command so a busy adapter cannot stall controller services for long.

Player assignment is managed by the ES-DE `Bluetooth Settings` TUI. Runtime
state is stored at:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/controllers/player-order.json
```

`controller-leds` watches Switch-style Bluetooth controller identities from
BlueZ and supported USB HID input nodes from the kernel, then applies
Switch-style player LED counts through sysfs according to the saved player
slots when that LED interface exists. It writes only changed LED files at a
bounded half-second cadence,
because each sysfs LED write sends a Nintendo output subcommand over Bluetooth
or USB HID. One-shot applies still force a single pattern refresh after explicit
assignment or pairing. Bluetooth connection truth comes from BlueZ, not stale
local HID nodes, so a disconnected Bluetooth controller is not kept alive only
because its old `/sys` input device has not disappeared yet. If a controller
identity does not expose LED sysfs entries, logical assignment still remains
stable. Some 8BitDo USB wired modes expose `2dc8:301a` through `hid-generic`;
that mode is tracked while connected as an input-only
`USB:<vendor>:<product>:<uniq>` player identity but does not expose Nintendo
player LED sysfs controls.
Connected controllers are compacted into the lowest open player slots while
preserving their relative order, so if P2 turns off P3/P4 slide down and the
returning controller lands at the end.
Controller add events and BlueZ `Connected` property changes trigger a debounced
one-shot reconcile after the connect/disconnect burst settles, and the
background reconcile uses a short D-Bus polling cadence with a lock so one-shot
and loop updates cannot race against each other. One-shot applies update the
background state marker, and LED writes are limited to entries that actually
need to change and serialized at a half-second cadence so hid-nintendo output
reports are not flooded.
The one-shot apply is not start-limited and briefly waits for a reconnecting
controller's LED sysfs path before relying on later retries.
`controller-autoconnect once 10` is the bounded Reconnect All path. It uses
BlueZ D-Bus state for discovery, attempts every paired Switch Pro-style
controller within the ten-second window, then performs one final LED reconcile.
It is not run as a continuous background service during normal play; controller
add events and BlueZ state changes handle ordinary reconciliation without
polling every paired controller forever.

Controller shortcuts follow a Rocknix-style Switch layout. Minus is the hotkey
modifier, Minus + X opens emulator quick menus where the active launch
mode supports it, and Star/Home is treated as a controller-local turbo button
when the firmware exposes it at all. Square/Capture opens native console Home
screens only where that binding is explicitly configured, such as Dolphin's Wii
profile, and otherwise does nothing. Every `run-emulator` launch starts a
lightweight per-process exit broker for Minus + Plus twice. Xbox defaults to
`xemu-hotkeys`, which starts a per-process broker and HMP socket for Minus + X
quick actions, Minus + B reset, Minus + L1 load `esde-slot1`, Minus + R1 save
`esde-slot1`, Minus + A screenshot, and Minus + Y debug monitor. Plain `xemu`
remains available as a fallback alternate.
Before every `run-emulator` launch, Boomer runs a synchronous controller
reconcile, writes `/run/ghostship-emulation/controllers/resolved-order.json`,
and generates emulator input config only for currently connected controllers.
Saved player order still lives at
`/srv/emulation/config/controllers/player-order.json`, but disconnected or stale
entries are ignored at launch. Controller gameplay mapping follows Batocera's
Switch Pro-style physical baseline while Boomer's Minus hotkey chords stay
unchanged: physical B/south is the primary south button, physical A/east is
the right/east button, physical Y/west is the left/west button, and physical
X/north is the top/north button. RetroArch pins that face map at launch for
resolved players, applies a Dreamcast physical face override, and enables
left-stick-to-D-pad only for systems whose original controller has no left
analog stick. N64 uses physical B for N64 A and physical Y for N64 B.

Controller launch acceptance is stricter than a timed smoke test. A timed launch
only proves the emulator process stayed alive long enough to be observed. For
controller changes, the required checks are:

- resolved P1-P4 order matches the connected controller order and LEDs before
  launch;
- generated emulator config contains only connected players;
- emulator logs do not reject the generated controller config;
- Select+Start twice closes the launched standalone emulator through the
  per-process broker;
- one live game per touched emulator family accepts input from the expected
  physical buttons.

Ryubing has an additional contract because it validates SDL3 controller profiles
at startup. Switch launch changes are accepted only when Ryubing keeps the
generated `Config.json`, logs no invalid-configuration warning, logs no `No
matching controllers found` warning for connected players, and a game can use
the generated `ProController` profile, including L+R join where applicable.
Ryubing input schema, GUID formatting, `led` blocks, and disabled keyboard
entries must be copied from a known live-accepted Ryubing profile or source
model, not inferred from SDL names alone. Generated Ryubing IDs mirror
Ryubing's own SDL3 duplicate-counter prefix plus stable GUID convention, and
`run-emulator` derives those IDs from the Linux input modalias bus, VID, PID,
and version fields, then asks Ryubing for the launch-environment input IDs when
a display is already available. This avoids displayless SDL3 probes producing a
different GUID than Ryubing uses under Xwayland. `run-emulator` keeps Ryubing's
global input profile enabled for launched games and mirrors the managed input
list into the launched title's `games/<titleid>` configuration so per-title
configuration files cannot hide the generated connected-player profiles. The
launcher refuses to launch if those generated profiles fail the local verifier.

Minus + R2 is intentionally unmapped for Xemu because there is no reliable
fast-forward command. RetroArch maps Minus hotkeys to save/load, reset,
FPS, screenshot, and fast-forward actions, exits on Minus + Plus twice through
the per-process broker, and uses only the managed base
`retroarch.cfg`, XDG `global.slangp`, and XDG per-core `.opt` files. PC Engine
CD and SuperGrafx default all five players to 6-button pads. Dolphin enables
only resolved connected GameCube/Wii slots in SDL player order and maps
GameCube face buttons by physical position: B->A, Y->B, A->X, and X->Y. Dolphin
launches with the raw hotkey broker profile, matching
the Xemu approach for Minus chords: Minus + B reset, Minus + L1 load slot 1,
Minus + R1 save slot 1, Minus + A screenshot, and Minus + R2 fast mode.
Minus + X quick actions and Minus + Y debug monitor stay unbound for GameCube
because Dolphin does not expose equivalent normal runtime actions. D-pad stays
on physical D-pad and analog movement stays on analog sticks for analog-capable
standalone systems. PCSX2 uses native PCSX2 hotkey bindings instead of an
external hotkey
broker: Minus + X opens the pause menu, Minus + B resets the VM, Minus + L1
loads state slot 1, Minus + R1 saves state slot 1, Minus + A saves a
screenshot, Minus + Y toggles the OSD/FPS overlay, and Minus + R2 holds
turbo/fast-forward. Square/Capture stays unbound for PCSX2 until Boomer has a
proven stable SDL guide-style binding. Standalone SDL emulators keep their
native left-stick mappings. Mupen64Plus-Next defaults all four N64 controller
paks to Rumble Pak.

ES-DE seeds empty editable custom collections at
`collections/custom-Local Multiplayer.cfg` and `collections/custom-Co-op.cfg`
and enables them through `CollectionSystemsCustom`. Populate them later with
one ROM path per line; ES-DE accepts paths relative to its root where practical.

`joycond` and `joycond-cemuhook` stay installed for manual experiments but are
not started by default. Boomer reads the kernel input devices directly for
emulator player order and owns its LED reconcile step before launches. Plugging
in a Switch Pro-style controller over USB refreshes wired player order and LEDs
only; automatic USB-assisted Bluetooth pairing is kept as the hidden
`switch-usb-bt-pair` proof helper until live hardware testing proves the
hidraw manual-pairing exchange is reliable. USB-assisted pairing must report
states precisely: `paired` means BlueZ reports Paired, Bonded, and Trusted;
`connected` means BlueZ reports Connected after the controller reconnects over
Bluetooth. Boomer must not show a pairing success message until the intended
state is verified. ES-DE under Gamescope does not provide a normal desktop
notification service, so user-visible pairing messages need an explicit
kiosk-visible Xwayland overlay or an ES-DE patch instead of `notify-send`.
Bluetooth Settings exposes `USB Pair Controller` for the bounded USB helper;
it refreshes LEDs afterward and reports paired/connected state only after
checking BlueZ.

Diagnostics:

```text
/srv/emulation/logs/controller-bluetooth-latency.log
/srv/emulation/logs/tools/bluetooth-pairing.log
controller-bluetooth-diagnostics 20
```

GameMode is enabled for emulator launches through `gamemoderun`. The kiosk user
must be in the `gamemode` group so GameMode's polkit rules allow its governor,
process priority, and split-lock helper commands without interactive
authentication. Boomer uses conservative GameMode defaults: performance CPU
governor, no iGPU heuristic downgrade, renice 10, I/O priority 0, split-lock
mitigation disabled while active, and no GPU overclock settings.

The diagnostics command writes a timestamped summary plus a short `btmon`
capture under `/srv/emulation/logs/bluetooth-diagnostics/`.
Full BlueZ/`hid-nintendo` debug logging is kept as an on-demand diagnostic path
only, because continuously logging controller health creates unnecessary load
during normal four-controller play.
`bluetoothd` runs with a small safe CPU scheduling boost, and system D-Bus gets
a smaller CPU weight bump because BlueZ control events use D-Bus. Do not enable
realtime scheduling or IRQ pinning by default; the live kernel already gives
Bluetooth HCI workers and IRQ threads elevated priority.

Wi-Fi stays available for SSH, but NetworkManager Wi-Fi profiles are constrained
to 5 GHz by default to avoid 2.4 GHz contention with Bluetooth. The ES-DE
`Wi-Fi Settings` TUI can allow 2.4 GHz after showing a Bluetooth performance
warning. Do not blacklist shared Wi-Fi/Bluetooth kernel modules until live
hardware confirms the adapter split.

## ES-DE Tools

The ES-DE Tools system exposes large-font terminal TUIs for `Bluetooth Settings`,
`Wi-Fi Settings`, and `Controller Maps`, plus restart, reboot, and shutdown.
The settings TUIs use a dark two-column layout: actions on the left,
selected-action status and details on the right. They support keyboard and
controller navigation from the couch. Bluetooth status shows whether Boomer is
scanning for nearby devices, but does not expose host-only discoverable or
pairable fields. `Show Paired` sits directly under status and previews all
paired devices in the right pane.
`Controller Maps` uses the same two-pane layout with a slightly smaller font.
Each page keeps a two-column button map at the top and only the hotkeys
supported by that emulator below it, so the right pane fits without ASCII
controller diagrams.
Non-status actions show only concise action help in the right pane so long
status blocks do not crowd the menu. Player assignment accepts keyboard input as
a player device, and B/Esc backs out before any assignment is made. Under the
ES-DE Gamescope session they launch through Xwayland `xterm`, with `foot` kept
as a pure Wayland fallback. Bluetooth pairing uses a 10-second non-interactive
BlueZ scan, parses newly discovered devices from the live scan output, hides
already connected devices, filters the picker to likely audio/controller/HID
peripherals, and shows whether each candidate is already paired. The pair
command registers a BlueZ agent for that command instead of relying on a stale
interactive session, and rechecks BlueZ state before treating a reported
pair/connect error as fatal. Keyboard input is handled by the terminal, while
the raw `/dev/input` reader is limited to real controller navigation devices so
Switch Pro IMU motion data and analog-stick idle noise do not move the menu.
`USB Pair Controller` runs the USB-assisted Switch Pro-style pairing helper for
one plugged-in controller and shows the verified result in the TUI, with an
Xwayland popup when the kiosk display is available.
Player assignment drains pending input before listening and accepts only a real
button/key press, so stale stick navigation cannot move a controller to another
slot. `Restart ES-DE` runs through a dedicated delayed system service outside
the frontend process tree; in kiosk mode it restarts the greetd-managed session,
and in console mode it restarts `emulation-session.service`.
Launch diagnostics are written under `/srv/emulation/logs/tools/`. Helper
scripts for audio, display, RetroArch, scraping, launch logs, ROM coverage,
smoke tests, and performance tests remain available on disk for SSH or
background use, but are not shown in the ES-DE menu.

These tools are exposed as an ES-DE `Tools` system. Upstream ES-DE does not
provide a stable Batocera-style API for arbitrary native main-menu actions; that
would require a maintained ES-DE source build or patch.

## Scraping Secrets

The scraper secret unit is `emulation-scraper-secrets` with:

- `SCREENSCRAPER_USER`
- `SCREENSCRAPER_PASS`

The generated projection is:

```text
/run/ghostship-secrets/emulation-scraper.env
```

`secrets/recipients.nix` gives `emulation-runtime` to operator edit keys and
the Boomer host key. Rekey the secret after changing recipients so the machine
can decrypt it at runtime.

## RetroAchievements Secrets

The RetroAchievements secret unit is `emulation-retroachievements-secrets` with:

- `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_USER`
- `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_PASS`
- `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_TOKEN`

The generated projection is:

```text
/run/ghostship-secrets/emulation-retroachievements.env
```

`render-retroachievements-settings` writes RetroArch's runtime `cheevos_*`
secret settings into the managed RetroArch append config:

```text
/srv/emulation/config/retroarch/retroachievements.cfg
```

For PCSX2 it writes `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_TOKEN` into PCSX2's native secrets layer
at `/srv/emulation/xdg/config/PCSX2/inis/secrets.ini`, while `run-emulator`
writes the matching non-secret `[Achievements]` settings into `PCSX2.ini`.
If the token is absent, PCSX2 achievements stay disabled and the status file
reports `pcsx2: missing-token`.

## Verification On Hardware

After SSH access exists:

1. Verify `emulation-scraper-secrets` and
   `emulation-retroachievements-secrets` decrypt and project credentials.
2. Verify the label-based Btrfs mounts for `/` and
   `/srv/emulation/roms`.
3. Boot to the tty, run `esde-preflight`, then launch ES-DE with
   `start-esde` and confirm Art Book Next appears.
4. Run `audio-route` and confirm HDMI audio on each physical HDMI port you
   intend to use.
5. Pair all four controllers in Switch mode and verify connection-order player
   assignment plus matching player-slot mappings in RetroArch and Dolphin.
6. Run `retroarch-shader-smoke-test`.
7. Launch one game per emulator family and inspect
   `/srv/emulation/logs/launches`.
8. Run `display-profile --matrix-test`, `rom-coverage-check`,
   `smoke-rom-select`, and `smoke-test --dry-run`.
9. Test 1080p, 1440p, 4K, and ultrawide displays and confirm fixed-aspect
   content stays centered and unstretched.
