# Development from the T3 Code container

Work in `/workspace/nixos-config` as the existing `t3code` user. This is a
Linux development container with a Nix daemon, not one of the fleet's NixOS
hosts. T3 Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Antigravity are maintained by the container
environment. Keep their existing launchers, credentials, and configuration.
Do not apply `home/profiles/develop.nix` or run
`ghostship-agent-maintenance` here; those target the NixOS develop hosts.

## Shared skills and tools

Install the existing Ghostship catalog for all three T3 Code providers:

```sh
python3 scripts/setup-container-agents.py
```

This builds `/workspace/ghostship-agent#default` with that repo's lock file,
keeps a persistent Nix GC root, and exposes its packaged commands through
`~/.local/bin`, already inherited by T3 Code and its providers. The package
includes `agent`, browser and Bitwarden tooling, Google Workspace tooling,
Printing Press, generated API clients, and shared Git tooling.

Codex/ChatGPT and OpenCode discover the same 15 shared skills under
`~/.agents/skills`; Antigravity ACP reads links to them under
`~/.gemini/config/skills`. Missing optional Antigravity `name` metadata is
supplied in an installed copy for Codex/OpenCode compatibility. Supporting
resources and the original source remain intact. Shared preferences and the
container path guidance are also published to the providers' native user
instruction files.

The installer preserves unrelated skills and refuses to replace unmanaged
commands or instruction files. It records its links so later runs can update
or prune only its own entries. Provider credentials, model choices, plugin
settings, and Codex's built-in skills are left in place. Provider-specific
plugins and hosted connectors remain provider-specific; sharing filesystem
skills does not transfer those plugins or their authentication to another CLI.

Run `t3code-shared-agents` to rebuild and refresh the package, or
`t3code-shared-agents --skills-only` to refresh discovery without a build. The
installer persists this helper and a T3 Code bootstrap hook in the user home,
so refreshes survive removal of the development worktree. The Nix-managed
container bootstrap also refreshes skills on subsequent deployments.

Check discovery with `opencode debug skill` and Codex app-server `skills/list`.
Start a fresh provider session to reload cached skill catalogs. Antigravity's
ACP skill paths were also verified against the bundled 1.1.1 server source.
See the [Codex skill documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills),
[OpenCode skill documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/), and
[Antigravity skill documentation](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills).

## Project tools and validation

Use the repository's pinned tools from any agent terminal:

```sh
cd /workspace/nixos-config
nix develop -c scripts/check
```

The default shell supplies Git, GitHub CLI, SSH, Nix, formatting and shell
validation tools, Node.js, Python, Ragenix, Age, and SSH-to-Age. It inherits
the container's agent launchers and authentication environment. It does not
require a login shell, Home Manager, Windows paths, or local root access.

For automatic shell activation, copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` if no local
file exists, then run `direnv allow`. `.envrc` stays ignored so existing local
environment settings and secrets are preserved. Non-interactive agent commands
can always use `nix develop -c` without direnv shell integration.

Use `nix develop .#browser` when a test needs local Playwright browser binaries
and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`. Ordinary Nix work does not download those
browsers. The browser shell inherits the default tools. Browser tests still
need the relevant project's JavaScript dependencies and any site credentials.

`scripts/check` parses all tracked Nix files, runs ShellCheck on the workflow
script, checks patch whitespace, and evaluates ci/default/browser shells for
`x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux` plus every host's full system derivation.
It uses the checked-in lock file without updating it. Stage new Nix files
before running checks. These checks validate module assertions and derivation
construction; target-host builds and live verification remain necessary for
deployment.

GitHub Actions runs this same command for PRs and pushes to `main`. A single
Linux job evaluates both architectures without building their systems, and
new pushes cancel superseded runs. Review CI and any Codex review comments
before marking a draft PR ready. Leave merging to the user.

## Git access

The container may provide GitHub token authentication without an SSH key.
Check access with `gh auth status`. For this checkout, HTTPS can use that
authentication without storing the token in the repository or changing global
Git configuration:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/caelx/nixos-config.git
git config --local credential.https://github.com.helper '!gh auth git-credential'
git ls-remote origin HEAD
```

Keep an existing SSH remote if its key is available. Use a named branch or
worktree, verify and commit changes, push, and open a draft PR. The repo's
`VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` track workflow changes as patch releases.

## Remote deployment

The container hostname identifies the coding environment. Always select the
target explicitly instead of using `.#$(hostname)` here. Host configuration
can be evaluated without root:

```sh
nix develop -c nix eval --raw \
  .#nixosConfigurations.chill-penguin.config.system.build.toplevel.drvPath
```

Provision the target's approved SSH identity and verified host key through the
container's persistent credential setup before deploying. The `chill-penguin`
SSH alias must select root on the real host. GitHub token access alone does
not provide host SSH access. Check it non-interactively:

```sh
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=10 chill-penguin id -u
```

The result must be `0`. If SSH access or Git push is unavailable, fix that
access before deployment. Do not substitute container-local activation or copy
uncommitted files onto the host.

After the user merges the PR, make sure the intended commit is on
`origin/main`. For an authorized deployment, use `ssh chill-penguin` and the
host checkout at `/home/nixos/nixos-config` to run these commands as root:

```sh
git -C /home/nixos/nixos-config pull --ff-only origin main
cd /home/nixos/nixos-config
nixos-rebuild build -L --impure --flake .#chill-penguin
./result/bin/switch-to-configuration switch
```

Run long or prompt-driven remote work in detached tmux, then inspect its output
with `capture-pane` and provide input with `send-keys`. The `--impure` flag on
Chill Penguin allows extraction from its local `/boot/asahi` firmware; the
container's pure evaluation cannot validate that hardware-specific step.
Verify affected live services after switching. Other hosts use their own
explicit flake target, root SSH access, and host-specific deployment procedure.
