## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hermes SHALL use one authoritative managed runtime surface
The self-hosted Hermes deployment on `chill-penguin` SHALL treat
`/home/hermes/.hermes` as the one authoritative managed runtime surface and
SHALL not depend on a repo-owned named-profile fleet for normal operation.

#### Scenario: Single-agent runtime is the only managed surface
- **WHEN** the Hermes container definition and host wiring are evaluated
- **THEN** `/home/hermes/.hermes` SHALL be the primary managed runtime path
- **AND** the supported contract SHALL not require `assistant`, `operations`,
  or `supervisor` profile homes under `~/.hermes/profiles/`
- **AND** repo-managed workflows SHALL not depend on profile-local `.env`,
  skill, or `SOUL.md` paths

### Requirement: Fresh single-agent runtime SHALL rebuild only from image defaults and supported host inputs
The fresh Hermes runtime created after a full reset SHALL rebuild its initial
state from the image-owned workstation defaults plus supported host-provided
runtime env and mounts.

#### Scenario: Fresh runtime does not inherit stale managed state
- **WHEN** Hermes boots for the first time after the full reset
- **THEN** the fresh runtime SHALL not inherit stale managed runtime state from
  the deleted home, workspace, or `/nix` paths
- **AND** the fresh runtime SHALL rely on current image-owned defaults for its
  initial workstation state
- **AND** operators SHALL need to perform any required fresh setup such as
  Codex auth inside the new persisted home

### Requirement: Hermes SHALL not configure a remote browser default through host wiring
The self-hosted Hermes host wiring SHALL leave upstream local-browser behavior
as the default and SHALL not emit a repo-managed remote browser CDP endpoint.

#### Scenario: Browser CDP defaults are omitted from generated host wiring
- **WHEN** the Hermes container environment is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL not include `BROWSER_CDP_URL`
- **AND** it SHALL not include `BROWSER_ASSISTANT_CDP_URL`,
  `BROWSER_OPERATIONS_CDP_URL`, or `BROWSER_SUPERVISOR_CDP_URL`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Single-agent cutover SHALL reset persisted Hermes state before deployment
The deployment workflow for the single-agent Hermes contract on
`chill-penguin` SHALL remove all persisted workstation state before the
refreshed image is started.

#### Scenario: Pre-deploy reset removes stale persisted state
- **WHEN** operators deploy the refreshed Hermes runtime contract to
  `chill-penguin`
- **THEN** they SHALL stop Hermes and remove `/srv/apps/hermes/home`,
  `/srv/apps/hermes/workspace`, and `/srv/apps/hermes/nix` before starting the
  updated service
- **AND** the reset SHALL discard persisted auth, memories, logs, XDG/userland
  state, custom skills, workspace contents, and user-installed Nix state from
  the previous runtime
- **AND** the updated service SHALL recreate clean persisted state that matches
  the current single-agent layout
- **AND** the rollout SHALL start the latest published
  `ghcr.io/caelx/ghostship-hermes:latest` image rather than a stale cached
  image
